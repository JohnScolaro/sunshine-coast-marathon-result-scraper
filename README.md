# Sunshine Coast Marathon Festival Results Scraper

I like to do data analysis, and I like to run. To do data analysis on running, data I need to get it from somewhere, so I built a scraper to hit the result website of the Sunshine Coast Marathon and format everyones results into a nice little JSON file for later processing.

## Setup

* Clone the repo down.
* Install it with `pip install .`
* Run the scaping script with `run`.
* Inspect and enjoy the produced .json file containing all race data.

If you also want to run the notebook to visualise some plots, you'll need to install a few more packages, but I'm sure you can handle that yourself.
